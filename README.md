# Project Overview
In this project, we'll cover the full process of building a beginner machine learning project. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. By the end, you'll understand how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.

We'll use data from historical Olympic games. We'll try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.

# Machine learning project steps
Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here. This outline will help you tackle any machine learning problem.

## Project Steps

Form a hypothesis.
* Find and explore the data.
* Clean the data for ML.
* Choose an error metric.
* Split your data.
* Train a model.
# Code
You can find the code for this project here.

# Local Setup
## Installation
To follow this project, please install the following locally:

* Python 3.8+
* Python packages
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn

# Data
We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on Kaggle.

Files we'll use in this project:

teams.csv - the team-level data that we use in this project. Included in this Here!!
* Check code to generate this data on `prep_teams_data.ipynb` (Included)

[athlete_events.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) - this is the original athlete-level data from Kaggle
